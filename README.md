## 1 THE UNLEVELED PLANE OF SQL THAT I LATER LEVELED
Under this plane of knowledge called DSA Incubator, I wass equippped with the following knowledges and I got the the following experiences:
### üíº Work Experience

üìòOverview of Kultra Mega Stores (KMS)
Kultra Mega Stores (KMS) is a retail and office supply company operating in multiple regions. This project explores their operational data from 2009 to 2012 to uncover patterns in:
- Sales performance by category and geography
- Customer segmentation and profitability
- Shipping method efficiency and alignment with priority
(The analysis was completed using SQL (SQL Server syntax) and supported by Excel for documentation.)
## üéØ Case Scenarios & Business Questions
### ‚úÖ Case Scenario I: Sales & Shipping
- Which product category had the highest sales?
- What are the Top 3 and Bottom 3 regions in terms of sales?
- What were the total sales of appliances in Ontario?
- What should be done to increase revenue from the bottom 10 customers?
- Which shipping method incurred the most cost?
### ‚úÖ Case Scenario II: Customer Insights
- Who are the most valuable customers, and what do they typically purchase?
- Which small business customer had the highest sales?
- Which corporate customer placed the most orders (2009‚Äì2012)?

### As part of a business analytics case for a retail company, I conducted deep-dive SQL analysis across customer segments, sales regions, product categories, and shipping methods. I worked directly in SQL Server, wrote performance-optimized queries, and exported insights to Excel for review.
*Key Contributions:*
- Identified top and bottom performing customers and product categories
- Assessed shipping costs vs. order priorities
- Joined and filtered data across multiple dimensions (customer, time, geography)
- Wrote reusable SQL scripts, exported result sets, and documented the entire process
üëâ You‚Äôll find all scripts and analysis in the above Screenshot.
